Throw your mistemper''d weapons to the ground,

And made Verona''s ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker''d with peace, to part your canker''d hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:

To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.

 players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do 
 not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
 gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
 whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
 temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
 soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
 tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
 (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
 shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp''d for o''erdoing
 Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it. <br><br>

 <del><b> First Player.</b> I warrant your honour. </del><br><br>

<b> Hamlet.</b> Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
 tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
 this special observance, that you o''erstep not the modesty of
 nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
 whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
 ''twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
 scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
 form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
 it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
 grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance 
 o''erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
 have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
 speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
 Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
 strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature''s 
 journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
 humanity so abominably. <br><br>

<del><b> First Player.</b> I hope we have reform''d that indifferently with us, sir. </del><br><br>

<b>Hamlet.</b> O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
 speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them 
 that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
 spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
 question of the play be then to be considered. That''s villanous
 and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
 make you ready. <br><br>
